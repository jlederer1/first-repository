ELIZA: Is something troubling you ?
YOU:   I hate logic.
ELIZA: I see. But logic is pretty important.
YOU:   But it always reminds me of my own lack of intelligence.
ELIZA: What could be done to improve it?
YOU:   Train more logic, perhaps.
ELIZA: Can't you be more positive ?
YOU:   I like linguistics.
ELIZA: Oh, good old linguistics. What's so exciting about it?
YOU:   It's all about drawing trees and stuff.
ELIZA: I still don't believe you really hate logic.
YOU:   It makes me think about intelligence.
ELIZA: Do you think, machines can be intelligent, too?
YOU:   No.
ELIZA: You are being a bit negative.
